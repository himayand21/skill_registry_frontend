This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project is imported from a bitbucket private repository. I have moved this project here for showcasing it as a public demo - hence, it shares a different database from the one being used in the actual application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
